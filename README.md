# Hello, I'm Isaac! 👋

I'm a **Front End Developer** who transitioned into tech from the photography industry and the arts, bringing my problem-solving and collaboration skills along with me. My journey into coding started in 2023 when I enrolled in the School of Code Bootcamp, where I dived head-first into the world of programming with no prior coding experience. 

## 🔧 Technologies & Tools

Below are some of the technologies I've learned and grown to enjoy:

- **Core**: JavaScript, HTML, CSS
- **Frameworks/Libraries**: React.js, Three.js
- **Version Control**: Git & GitHub
- **Package Managers**: npm
- **APIs**: REST, Express.js
- **Databases**: SQL, Supabase
- **Testing**: Jest, React Testing Library
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
- **Other**: Agile methodologies, pair programming, problem-solving

## 🚀 Quick facts

- 🔭 I've focused my learning journey on both **Frontend** and **Backend** technologies, striving to be a versatile Full Stack Developer.
- 🌱 I'm always looking for opportunities to collaborate on projects or learn new tech.
- 🎯 I'm currently open to opportunities as a Junior Front End Developer or Full Stack Developer.
- 🍄 When I'm not coding, you'll find me foraging for Mushrooms in the Woods around Brighton.
